	When choosing artwork for your games, be sure to pay attention to licensing. The safest and cheapest way to start is to use freely licensed graphics that you can modify from a website like http://pixabay.com/. You can use almost any type of image file in your game, but it’s easiest if you use a bitmap (.bmp) file because Pygame loads bitmaps by default. Although you can configure Pygame to use other file types, some file types depend on certain image libraries that must be installed on your computer. (Most images you’ll find are in .jpg, .png, or .gif formats, but you can convert them to bitmaps using tools like Photoshop, GIMP, and Paint.) Pay particular attention to the background color in your chosen image. Try to find a file with a transparent background that you can replace with any background color using an image editor. Your games will look best if the image’s background color matches your game’s background color. Alternatively, you can match your game’s background to the image’s background.
